# Pomodoro-Timer
Notifies the user when to go back to work mode or study mode. The timer can be adjusted to the user's preference.

The 1st button starts the clock at the original set time, the 2nd button reduces the previous work time by 25%, and the 3rd button starts the rest time.
When the time is up, the LED will start doing a slow fade blink for both modes. When work mode ends, the buzzer will beep for ~1 second.
